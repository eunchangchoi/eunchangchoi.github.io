<p>I am a Korean legal scholar at Seoul National University Law School and a fellow of <a href="https://thefreeinternetproject.org/"> the Free Internet Project </a>at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. I have been actively participating in Law Committee of <a href="https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/">IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems</a>, and Expert Council of Robot Ethics of Korea. My current research  primarily focuses on the intersection of law and AI, applied ethical and governance challenges in AI, safety concerns arising from transformative AI, global data law, and regulatory policy on emerging technologies. Recently I have consulted with <a href="https://www.kisdi.re.kr/"> Korea Information Society Development Institute (KISDI)</a>, <a href="http://www.stepi.re.kr/">Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI)</a> and South Korean <a href="https://www.4th-ir.go.kr"> Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution</a>on AI policy. 
  <p> I have taught at Korea University Graduate School of International Studies and Ewha Womans University, and <a href="https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2019-05-14-en"> the Asia Pacific Internet Governance Academy(APIGA)</a> about multistakeholder perspectives on ethical framework of AI.  Previously, I was a resident fellow of <a href="https://https://law.yale.edu/isp"> Information Society Project at Yale Law School</a>, where I worked as a coordinator of Harvard-Yale Cyberscholar Working Group. I also have held an appointment as a visiting scholar at <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/centres-institutes/centre-socio-legal-studies"> Centre for Socio-Legal Studies,Oxford Law Faculty</a>. I was an invited expert of <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/07/privacy-ig-charter"> W3C Privacy Interest Group</a> and a fellow of STEPI, a leading think tank of South Korea.</p> 
<p> My articles addressed underlying legal, policy issues associated with computer algorithm, Internet architecture, data privacy in cloud computing, legal foundation of data ownership, and platform liability. I have authored books <i> Al Governance </i>(forthcoming) and <i>The Future of Fake News</i>(forthcoming), <i> Layered Model of Regulation</i>, and co-authored <i>AI:Power Shift and International Politicsa</i> with political scientists. I have also translated <i> The Weath of Networks</i> written by Yochai Benkler (Yale Univ Press),<i> Meme in Digital Culture,</i> and <i>Internet of Things</i> (MIT Press) into Korean. </p>
<p> I am sitting on a steering committee of the Korea Internet Governance Alliance(KIGA) that brings diverse stakeholders together to participate in the dialogue related to Internet policy. At the annual meeting of <a href="http://krigf.kr"> Korea Internet Governance Forum(Kr-IGF)</a>, I have organized workshops on the future of AI, ethical framework for a good AI society, transformative applications of AI  in cybersecurity, cybersecurity & encryption policy, a data governance in social media. A decade ago, college volunteers, public interest lawyers and I have launched the <a href="http://www.povertyinfo.org"> Global Poverty Public Awareness Project</a>, an information commons initiative that provides citizens with open knowledge about issues affecting global poverty, and how AI and open data facilitate sustainable global development.</p>
