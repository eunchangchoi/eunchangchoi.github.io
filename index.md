<p>I am a Korean legal scholar and a fellow of <a href="https://thefreeinternetproject.org/"> the Free Internet Project </a>at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. From 2018, I have been a member of Law Committee,<a href="https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/">IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems</a>, and Expert Council of Robot Ethics of Korea. My current research focuses on governance of artificial intelligence, global data law, and regulatory policy on emerging technologies. Recently I have consulted with <a href="https://www.kisdi.re.kr/"> Korea Information Society Development Institute (KISDI)</a>, <a href="http://www.stepi.re.kr/">Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI)</a> and South Korean <a href="https://www.4th-ir.go.kr"> Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution</a>on AI policy, and taught multistakeholder perspectives on ethical framework of AI at <a href="https://www.icann.org/news/announcement-2-2019-05-14-en"> the Asia Pacific Internet Governance Academy(APIGA)</a>. Previously, I was a resident fellow of <a href="https://https://law.yale.edu/isp"> Information Society Project at Yale Law School</a>, where I served as a coordinator of Harvard-Yale Cyberscholar Working Group. I also have held an appointment as a visiting scholar at <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/centres-institutes/centre-socio-legal-studies"> Centre for Socio-Legal Studies,Oxford Law Faculty</a>. I was an invited expert of <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/07/privacy-ig-charter"> W3C Privacy Interest Group</a> and a fellow of STEPI, a leading think tank of South Korea.</p> 
<p> My articles primarily addressed underlying legal, policy issues associated with computer algorithm, Internet architecture, data privacy in cloud computing, data ownership, and social media platform. I have authored books <i> Layered Model of Regulation, Al Governance</i>(forthcoming) and <i>The Future of Fake News</i>(forthcoming), and also translated<i> The Weath of Networks</i> written by Yochai Benkler (Yale Univ Press),<i> Meme in Digital Culture,</i> and <i>Internet of Things</i> (MIT Press). </p>
<p> I am sitting on a steering committee of the Korea Internet Governance Alliance(KIGA) that brings diverse stakeholders together to participate in the dialogue related to Internet policy. At the annual meeting of <a href="http://krigf.kr"> Korea Internet Governance Forum(Kr-IGF)</a>, I have organized workshops on the future of AI, ethical framework for a good AI society,  transformative applications of AI  in cybersecurity, cybersecurity & encryption policy, a data governance in social media. Many volunteers, lawyer friends and I have launched the <a href="http://www.povertyinfo.org"> Global Poverty Public Awareness Project</a>, an information commons initiative that provides citizens with open knowledge about issues affecting global poverty, and how AI and open data help sustainable global development.</p>
