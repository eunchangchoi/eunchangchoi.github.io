<p style="font-size:1.1em">I,<a href="https://thecourtyard.law.yale.edu/hub/yalelaw/profile/eunchangchoi"> 최은창 崔恩彰</a>,
am a Korean legal scholar focused on information law, Internet policy and AI algorithms, and a Non-Resident Fellow of<a href="https://thefreeinternetproject.org/"> the Free Internet Project </a> at <a href="https://web.iit.edu/">Illinois Institute of Technology</a>. Initially, my research tackled legal issues related to intellectual property rights, and later it gradually expanded to Internet regulation, social media and data regulations. Today, my central research questions lie at the intersection of the law, tech policy, data, and AI algorithm (value alignment in autonomous systems, fake news, and governance challenges of AI). I have been invited to the Expert Council of Robot Ethics of <a href="https://www.k-robot.org/"> Korea Institute for Robot Industry Advancement</a>, and KAIST Fourth Industrial Revolution Intelligence Center. Recently I have consulted for <a href="https://www.kisdi.re.kr/"> Korea Information Society Development Institute (KISDI)</a>, <a href="http://www.stepi.re.kr/eng"> Science and Technology Policy Institute (STEPI)</a> and South Korean <a href="https://www.4th-ir.go.kr"> Presidential Committee on the Fourth Industrial Revolution </a> on AI policy and strategy. I participate in 'AI Policy Forum', a part of <a href="http://kaail.or.kr"> Korean Associaton for Artificial Intelligence & Law</a> where I presented a paper titiled "Differences in Risk Perception of AI and Modality of Governance".
  <p style="font-size:1.1em"> Previously, I was a Resident Fellow of <a href="https://law.yale.edu/isp"> Information Society Project, Yale Law School </a>, where I served as a coordinator of Harvard-Yale-MIT Cyberscholar Working Group. I also have held an appointment as a Visiting Scholar at <a href="https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/centres-institutes/centre-socio-legal-studies"> Centre for Socio-Legal Studies, University of Oxford </a>. I was an Invited Expert of <a href="https://www.w3.org/2011/07/privacy-ig-charter"> W3C Privacy Interest Group</a> and a Fellow of <a href="http://www.stepi.re.kr/eng"> STEPI</a>, a global think tank in the area of science and technology. From 2018, I have been actively participating in Law Committee of <a href="https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/">IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems</a>, and its working groups (P7002 'Data Privacy Process', P7001 'Transparency of Autonomous Systems'). My teaching experences include 'Global Information Society and Policy' at <a href="https://gsis.korea.ac.kr"> Korea University Graduate School of International Studies</a> and 'The Ethics in Information Systems' at <a href="http://biz.ewha.ac.kr/eng/"> Ewha Womans University Graduate School of Business</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Politics.Media"> 'Media and Politics'</a> at Konkuk University Department of Political Science, and <a href="https://community.icann.org/display/GSEAPAC/APIGA+2019"> the Asia Pacific Internet Governance Academy(APIGA)</a> organized by the  <a href="https://www.icann.org"> Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)</a>.</p> 
<p style="font-size:1.1em"> My articles primarily addressed underlying legal, policy issues associated with computer algorithm, Internet architecture, data privacy in cloud computing, legal foundation of data ownership, and platform liability. I have authored several books — <i> The Global Governance of Artificial Intelligence </i>(forthcoming) and <i> The Future of Fake News: Bustling Democracy in the Algorithmic Age </i>(forthcoming Jan. 2020), <i>Layered Model of Regulation</i>, and co-authored <i> AI:Power Shift and International Politics</i> with political scientists. Besides, I have translated <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/wealth_of_networks/Main_Page"> <i> The Wealth of Networks: How social production transforms markets and freedom </i></a> written by<a href="https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10071/Benkler"> Yochai Benkler </a>(Yale Univ Press),<i> Memes in Digital Culture </i>(MIT Press), and <i> The Internet of Things</i> (MIT Press) into Korean. I also presented a paper titled 'The Making of South Korean Robot Ethics Charter' at 2019 <a href="https://www.icres2019.org/"> International Conference on Robot Ethics and Standards </a> in London. Besides, I delivered my speech on 'IP Address and Cross-border Cooperation for Resolving the Cyber Attribution Challenge'at <a href="https://conference.apnic.net/48/program/schedule/#/day/6"> APNIC 48 conference </a> in Chiang Mai, and taught <a href=" https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/AsiaPacific/SiteAssets/Pages/Events/2019/Artificial-Intelligence-Overview-and-Applications/%5bITU%20CoE%5d%20AI%20Ethics%2c%20Security%2c%20Personal%20Data_Choi%20Sept%2017%202019.pdf">'AI: Ethics, Security, Personal Data and Governance'</a> at <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regional-Presence/AsiaPacific/Pages/Events/2019/Artificial-Intelligence-Overview-and-Applications.aspx"> ITU Centres of Excellence Network for Asia-Pacific Region</a> in Bangkok. I am invited to a workshop <a href= "https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-2019-ws-182-data-governance-for-smarter-city-mobility">'Data Governance for Smarter City Mobility'</a> organized by <a href= "https://www.hiig.de/en/project/data-governance/"> Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society(HIIG)</a> in Berlin.<br>
   </p>  <p style="font-size:1.1em"> 
Currently I represent South Korea's Internet Community at <a href="http://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/igf-regional-and-national-initiatives"> National Regional Initiatives(NRI)</a> moderated by <a href="http://intgovforum.org/multilingual/"> the IGF Secretariat of the UN under Department of Economic and Social Affairs </a>, and have been involved in <a href="http://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/bpf-internet-of-things-iot-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence-ai-2018">the Best Practice Forum(BPF) IoT-Big Data-AI</a> of it. From 2017, I have been sitting on a steering committee of Korea Internet Governance Alliance(KIGA) that brings diverse stakeholders together to participate in the dialogue related to Internet policies. At<a href="http://krigf.kr"> Korea Internet Governance Forum(Kr-IGF)</a>, I have organized workshops on ethical framework for AI society, cybersecurity policy, and data governance. In 2010, with college volunteers and public interest lawyers, I have launched <a href="http://www.povertyinfo.org"> the Global Poverty Public Awareness Project (Povertyinfo.org)</a> that disseminates open knowledge about global poverty, and <a href="http://www.un.org/en/sections/issues-depth/big-data-sustainable-development/index.html"> how open data analytics facilitate sustainable global development</a>. Povertyinfo.org has been inspired by <a href="https://law.yale.edu/isp/about/initiatives/access-knowledge"> <i> Access to Knowledge</i> </a> initiative, Yochai Benkler's information commons, and <a href= "https://civic.mit.edu/"> MIT Center for Civic Media</a> in that it has combined social media, decentralized participant-driven working method and digital technology to augment citizen engagement more widely. I am a graduate of <a href="https://law.yale.edu/"> Yale Law School</a>, and <a href="http://law.snu.ac.kr/index_en.php"> Seoul National University Graduate School of Law,</a> and hold certificates from Duke-Geneva Institute in Transnational Law at <a href="https://www.unige.ch/droit/en/international//"> Université de Genève</a>, Switzerland, and from Intetnet Law Program at<a href="https://www.cyber.harvard.edu/"> The Berkman Center Internet & Society, Harvard Law School.</a> <br>
